\description{
\pkg{Giotto} has several functions that utilize python packages. To
facilitate this, utilities are provided for creating, removing, and
attaching python environments. Python environments are currently handled
entirely through \pkg{reticulate}.

\strong{Creating an environment}

\code{installGiottoEnvironment()} can be used to create a default environment
called \code{giotto_env} that includes some commonly used python packages. See
the \strong{python versions} section for specific packages and version numbers.

Custom environments managed through \pkg{reticulate} are also compatible
and can be hooked into by Giotto after creation.

\strong{Choosing environments}

Only one python environment may be initialized and used by \pkg{reticulate}
during a single R session. In order to switch to another environment, the
R session must be restarted.

Whenever any of the following happens for the first time in a session:
\itemize{
\item \code{giotto} object creation
\item \code{giottoInstructions} creation (\code{createGiottoInstructions()})
\item \code{GiottoClass::set_giotto_python_path()} is called (most straightforward)
}

Giotto automatically detects AND activates a python environment based on the
following defaults in decreasing priority:
\enumerate{
\item User provided (when \code{python_path} is not \code{NULL})
\item Any provided path or envname in option \code{"giotto.py_path"}
\item Default expected giotto environment location based on
\code{\link[reticulate:miniconda_path]{reticulate::miniconda_path()}}
\item Envname \code{"giotto_env"}
\item System default python environment
}

This behavior is mediated by the \code{set_giotto_python_path()} utility
function, which will find an environment and then initialize it. You can
also call \code{checkGiottoEnvironment()} in order to detect if there is an
environment usable by Giotto without initializing.
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{checkGiottoEnvironment()}: \itemize{
\item Based on \code{envname}, detect if there is a conda or miniconda installation
accessible by \pkg{Giotto} without initializing any python environments.
This is done by detecting if there is a python executable in the
expected location. Leaving \code{envname} as \code{NULL} (default) will let
\pkg{Giotto} autodetect a python env to use. See section for
\code{set_giotto_python_path()} for details on the autodetection.
\item Returns \code{TRUE} if an env is detected and accessible by Giotto. \code{FALSE}
if not. Will not initialize a python environment during detection.
}

\item \code{installGiottoEnvironment()}: \itemize{
\item Install a giotto python environment using the miniconda system as
implemented by \pkg{reticulate}. Once this  environment is installed it
will be automatically detected when you run the
\pkg{Giotto} toolbox. \cr This includes a
miniconda installation and also a set of python packages that \pkg{Giotto}
may often use. See details for further information on setting up an
environment with a .yml
\item Returns \code{NULL}
}

\item \code{removeGiottoEnvironment()}: \itemize{
\item Remove a python environment
\item Returns \code{NULL}
}

\item \code{set_giotto_python_path()}: \itemize{
\item Detect and activate a python path. The \code{python_path} param
accepts both full filepaths to the python executable and envnames. The
final path to use is determined as follows in decreasing priority:
\enumerate{
\item User provided (when \code{python_path} is not \code{NULL})
\item Any provided path or envname in option \code{"giotto.py_path"}
\item Default expected giotto environment location based on
\code{\link[reticulate:miniconda_path]{reticulate::miniconda_path()}}
\item Envname "giotto_env"
\item System default python environment
}
\item This function exits without doing anything if option \code{"giotto.use_conda"}
is \code{FALSE}. By default this function will also force initialization of the
python to set, locking the session to the set python. This can be skipped
if \code{initialize = FALSE}, however the actual python path set may differ from
what is expected and reported by this function. Additionally,
\code{\link[reticulate:py_available]{reticulate::py_available()}} will still show as \code{FALSE}.
\item Returns detected path to python binary or \code{NULL} if none found.
}

\section{python versions}{
By default, Python v3.10.2 will be used with the following python modules
for giotto environment installation:
\preformatted{
   - pandas==1.5.1
   - networkx==2.8.8
   - python-igraph==0.10.2
   - leidenalg==0.9.0
   - python-louvain==0.16
   - python.app==1.4
   - scikit-learn==1.1.3
}

The giotto environment can be custom installed by changing the
python_version parameter and module versions in the
\code{packages_to_install} parameter.

For example, this giotto environment works as well, and was the
default environment status for past releases of Giotto.
Python  v3.6
\preformatted{
  - pandas==1.1.5
  - networkx==2.6.3
  - python-igraph==0.9.6
  - leidenalg==0.8.7
  - python-louvain==0.15
  - python.app==2 # macOS only
  - scikit-learn==0.24.2
}
}

\section{.yml installs}{
Please note that multiple .yml files are provided in the
repository for advanced installation and convenience. To install the most
up-to-date Giotto environment using a .yml file, open a shell compatible
with conda/miniconda and navigate to the directory specified by
\code{system.file(package = "Giotto", "python/configuration")}. Once in this
directory, run the following to create your environment in one step:

\preformatted{conda env create -n giotto_env -f ./genv.yml}
}

\examples{
# detect without initialization
# check default env location
checkGiottoEnvironment()

# use environment name
checkGiottoEnvironment("giotto_env")

# full path 
# (use this if a different install location specified with .condarc)
if (FALSE) {
checkGiottoEnvironment(
    "/Users/example/Library/r-miniconda-arm64/envs/giotto_env/bin/pythonw"
)
}
if (FALSE) {
# default environment installation
installGiottoEnvironment()

# install to alternate location
temp_env <- tempdir()
installGiottoEnvironment(mini_install_path = temp_env)
}

# detect AND initialize a python environment
set_giotto_python_path()
}
